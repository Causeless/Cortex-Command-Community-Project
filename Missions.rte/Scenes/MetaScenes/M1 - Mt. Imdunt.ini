	PresetName = M1 - Mt. Imdunt
	Description = Large mountain with a steep cliff. Its treacherous terrain caused the death of its first discoverer, a scout of unknown origin, whose corpse can still be found partially preserved by the cold climate. The exact reason for his fall is unknown, but the mountain was dubbed "Imdunt," a S'vaari word with an approximate translation of "death by carelessness."
