Hello Daniel,

I've uploaded the libraries you need to build the Mac version of Cortex Command. You can find pkglib.tar.gz in the ftp area.

There are a number of things in there.

The Universal Allegro Framework - normally placed in /Library/Frameworks/

The header files for boost-1_36 - I had then in /usr/local/include

The fmod include files - in /usr/local/include/fmod

The luabind include directories - /usr/local/include/luabind

SDL includes /usr/local/include/SDL

Lua include /usr/local/include

Libraries (Compiled for Universal)

The following placed in /usr/local/lib

libfmod.a
libluabind.a
liblua.a
libSDLmain.a
libSDL.dynlib


You will need cmake to generate the Xcode project files. You can get cmake from here. http://www.cmake.org/ I'm using version 2.6-1

You need to place the *.cmake files in share/cmake into /usr/local/share/cmake/. This files extend cmake to search for some additional libraries it's not aware of out of the box. Specifically allegro and lua.

You'll need to make some changes to the cmake build cache once it does the defaults (it's a bit buggy). To make a universal build you need to set

CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURE to ppc;i386

and

CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT to /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk

It's a bit fiddly but hopefully you'll only have to do this once for a long time. I'll be awaiting any questions you have setting up.
