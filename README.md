# Setup Process #

First you need to download the necessary files:
1. Clone this Source Repository and the [Data Repository](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Data) in neighbouring folders. **Do Not** change the folder names unless you want to make trouble for yourself.

2. Copy *Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source\external\sources\zlib\DLLs\dll32\zlibwapi.dll* and *Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source\external\lib\win\lua51.dll* into the Data Repository

3. Copy *Scenes.rte* and *Metagames.rte* from your purchased copy of Cortex Command into the Data Repository.

Now you're ready to build and run the game. Simply open RTEA.sln with Visual Studio 2017 launch it.
* Use "Debug Open Source" configuration to debug (be prepared, it's very slow).
* Use "Final Open Source" configuration to build release .exe.
