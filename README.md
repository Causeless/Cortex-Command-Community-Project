**How To Contribute**
So you want to contribute to the project? A good start would be going to the discord where the project is hosted. You can find a link [https://discord.gg/SdNnKJN](here). After that, all our releases will be available under the releases area and all of our bugs and changes and ideas are tracked in github issues. Feel free to play and suggest changes or point out any problems.

If you've got experience with the game's ini data through modding it, are good at spriting or know lua, maybe you can contribute some of your time directly to the project. We'll look at any pull requests that come in and are always happy to have more hands on deck.

If you're an experienced programmer (particularly with C++), there's also tons of work to be done in our [https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source](source) repository.
