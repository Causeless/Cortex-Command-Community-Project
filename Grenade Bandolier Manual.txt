How to create a grenade	bandolier:
	Requirements: A predefined TDExplosive/ThrownDevice, in other words the grenade you want the bandolier to have.

	1º: You have to define a grenade bandolier item in ini as an TDExplosive/ThrownDevice.
		Preferably below the previous grenade, and preferably named something like " 'Grenade name' Bandolier "

			-The quickest way to do so is to just copy the ini of the actual grenade and remove any lua scripts it may have

			-OPTIONAL: You can also remove stuff like explosion gibs (smoke, etc), and gib sounds of that nature.

	2º: Give it the script "Base.rte/Devices/Shared/Scripts/GrenadeBandolier.lua"

	3º: Give it this list of CustomNumberValues in the ini:

		AddCustomValue = StringValue
			Grenade Name = Frag Grenade
		AddCustomValue = StringValue
			Grenade Tech = Coalition.rte
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Grenade Count = 3
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Replenish Rate = 0
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Bandolier Mass = 1.5

		-WARNING: if your device is a ThrownDevice instead of a TDExplosive, then you must also input this custom value:

		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Thrown Device = 1

	4º Modify said values:
		-Grenade Name: The name of the predefined TDExplosive/ThrownDevice you want the bandolier to use
		-Grenade Tech: From what tech the grenade is from
		-Grenade Count: How many grenades come per bandolier
		-Replenish Rate: How long, in ms, does the bandolier take before replenishing the grenade
		-Bandolier Mass: The starting weight of the bandolier that will be attached to the actor

	5º Modify the bandolier item's mass and goldprice (IMPORTANT):
		-The mass of the bandolier item should be defined as: Mass = Bandolier Mass + (Grenade Mass * Grenade Count)
			-Grenade mass is the mass of the TDExplosive/ThrownDevice the bandolier is going to use
			-EXAMPLE:
				AddCustomValue = NumberValue
					Bandolier Mass = 2
				AddCustomValue = NumberValue
					Grenade Count = 3

				The mass of an individual grenade is 1.5

				The mass of the bandolier item should then be: 2 + (1.5*3) = 6.5

		-The gold price of the bandolier item should be defined as: GoldValue = Grenade Value * Grenade Count
			-EXAMPLE: A grenade cost 10 oz and its bandolier has 3 grenades. The bandolier should then cost 30 oz

	6º: Make the actual grenade non-buyable with the ini property "Buyable = 0".
		-Make sure to replace them in your loadouts for their bandolier counterparts

	7º(OPTIONAL): Give it an icon like those of vanilla with the number of grenades in the bandolier

	8º(OPTIONAL): Write in the desc the replenish rate and bandolier mass stats like in vanilla
